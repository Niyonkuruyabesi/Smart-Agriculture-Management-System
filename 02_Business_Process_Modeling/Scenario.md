Scenario;

The process of managing a smart farm using IoT sensors begins when the Farm Manager initiates daily monitoring. The manager reviews alerts and reports via dashboards to identify anomalies such as low soil moisture, high temperatures, or livestock health issues. If any alert requires manual approval—such as activating irrigation in a new field—the manager decides whether to approve the action. If no action is required, the process ends; otherwise, the process continues, instructing either the IoT System or farm employees to take action.

The IoT System continuously collects sensor data from crop fields, greenhouses, and livestock areas. Sensors measure parameters like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and animal vitals. If soil moisture falls below a predefined threshold, the IoT system automatically activates irrigation devices and notifies farm employees to monitor the process. If moisture is adequate, the system logs the data without further action.

In addition to irrigation, the IoT system manages greenhouse conditions by adjusting temperature, humidity, and lighting to optimize crop growth. Livestock health and location are tracked via sensors, with any irregularities flagged for farm employee attention.

Farm employees play a critical role in manual interventions. They update farm records for harvested crops, livestock treatments, or other manual actions. Employees also respond to alerts, resolving issues such as treating sick animals or fixing malfunctioning equipment. If no further action is needed, the process for that task ends.

Throughout the process, the farm leverages automation via IoT for routine monitoring and interventions, while relying on human decision-making for critical approvals and manual problem-solving. Data flows from the IoT system to employees and managers, ensuring informed decisions and efficient farm operations.
